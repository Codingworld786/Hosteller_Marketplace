Roadmap to Implement This Idea
We'll break it down into phases to make it manageable:

🔹 Phase 1: Research & Planning
Define Your Target Audience

College students, hostel residents, PG tenants
Corporate professionals who frequently relocate
Market Research

Identify existing platforms (OLX, Quikr, Facebook Marketplace)
Find their gaps & how your platform will be different
Business Model & Monetization

Fixed listing fee (e.g., ₹50 per item)
Subscription model for verified sellers
Commission-based transaction fee (optional)
🔹 Phase 2: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Tech Stack Recommendation:

Frontend: React.js / Next.js
Backend: FastAPI (Python) / Node.js

🔹 Phase 3: Core Features Development

Automatic pricing suggestion (optional)
3️⃣ Product Browsing & Buying

“Show Interest” or “Add to Cart” options
4️⃣ Notification & Communication System

Implement a review system to build trust
Potential Challenges & Solutions

Trust issues between buyers & sellers	Provide admin moderation & escrow payment (optional)
